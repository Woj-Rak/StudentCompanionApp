# Student Companion App
Student Companion App is an Android application developed as a submission for 300CEM an Android Development Module at Coventry University.
The aim of the app is to help students suceed by providing them with tools necessary to stay organised and on top of their assignments and other student responsibilities.

# Layout
The app uses a tabbed layout, this means that all the most important features of the app are on the main screen of the app. There are no complicated menus to get to another feature, the only thing the user has to do to access another main feature of the app is to scroll right or left. To achieve this fragments are used. Every tab is a seperate fragment that can have its own layout and functionality independent to the activity its running in.
